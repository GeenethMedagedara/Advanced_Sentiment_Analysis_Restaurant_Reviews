"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">unfortunately my husband reacts to msg (ajinomoto), which is a flavor enhancer not normally used in Thai food.  We thought we were safe in a Thai restaurant, but, to be safe, we talked with the waitress about his reaction , and the waitress, kindly, changed our order to avoid any possibility of msg.  <br><br>We are currently in the emergency room, because he has a very bad reaction to the food.  Despite the waitress' assurance, the cooks avoided all flavoring EXCEPT msg.  <br><br>My food was bland.  His was bland, but it contained msg, even though we specified no msg and even though we said he was so allergic he needed to go to the hospital.<br><br>We will avoid Home in the future. <br><br>Service was good except for the msg confusion.

The portions are large and the 4 star rating holds true as some things are quite not on par with Thai but all in all a pretty good value for Sydney dining. Spicy basil chicken was good and dessert with shaved ice was lacking flavor.</span>",4 star rating,"Feb 6, 2024","San Clemente, CA"

We tried to change the order since the waitress forgot a dish, but we couldn't. We ordered chicken Pad Thai and seafood glass noodle Pad Thai with 2 beers and a wine.<br>The meal came at different times, so m wife had nearly finished her meal when I received mine.

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I usually love exploring different restaurants when I'm traveling... with that said, I happily came here twice within a week.  <br><br>Some of their dishes, i.e. Som Tum, come in a HUGE portions, while I could've done with helpings more of their curry dishes i.e. their sweet Penang Curry.  Their Pad Thai was another HUGE dish that was delicious and served with the traditional sides of sugar, chili, and peanuts. My colleagues and I barely had enough room on the table for all the dishes we ordered (and shared family style).  <br><br>I loved everything that was ordered with the exception of the Tamarind Sauce Fish. Other than that, let your happy self go wild. <br><br>Home Thai is one of the best Thai restaurants I've eat at outside of Thailand. Jing jing.</span>",5 star rating,"Mar 29, 2018","Chicago, IL"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">As others have stated, Home Thai Restaurant is a sprawl of culinary efficiency that's become a hot spot in Sydney, and while I developed a tremendous amount of respect for their speed and friendliness, I wasn't particularly blown away by their iteration of my all-time favorite Thai Dish Panang Curry.<br><br>Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?<br><br>By Sydney Restaurant standards, Home Thai has some serious real estate, and they fill the space with some pretty high density seating. While you won't be knee to knee or elbow to elbow with your neighbors, you'll be able to hear every word they say, so maybe find a different location for an intimate date.<br><br>However, if you're fine with some close quarters, you can sit back and watch the smooth efficiency with which Home Thai is run. Yes, the queue can grow long, but they burn through it quickly and from there can easily have your food out five minutes post order. It's all very impressive. Star.<br><br>Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?<br><br>There's great value to be had at Home Thai. Good sized curry dishes are priced as low as $12.00 AUD, which is blissfully cheap especially if you're coming from the States with a very advantageous exchange rate. Star. <br><br>Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?<br><br>My Panang Curry had all the potential in the world with the right mix of fresh ingredients and some fluffy accompanying jasmine rice. However, the consistency was a bit of a strike, with a more watery than creamy textures and a flavor profile that didn't quite pop in the way that I typically expect any yellow curry to do. Single Star. <br><br>Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?<br><br>Home Thai is a great experience, but their dishes fall a bit short of other Thai I've had.

She wrote 10dollars and then gave me five dollars and five... Then they told her that she only paid me ten dollars. Is it possible for the waiter to charge more money for the restaurant without paying attention?<br>The price is also lower than that of another Thai restaurant in Haymarket<br>An extra portion of rice hasn't been served for 20 minutes, but it was served after a rush. The dishes of the guests who came later than us were served<br>Then the mango glutinous rice had to be reminded to serve.

There was quite a line when we stopped by but the service is stunningly efficient here and the line moved quickly. The atmosphere is fantastic and bustling, with an open kitchen and conversation all around. We ordered the crispy pork belly (soo crispy, bursting with flavor and not too spicy) and the pineapple fried rice (fyi it's got seafood in it and the pineapple adds such a unique flavor) - we stuffed our faces and were left wishing we still had room for dessert, which looked incredible!</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 3, 2019","Los Angeles, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">We found Home Thai on Yelp and were not disappointed!  We arrived early, just before the line formed, and were seated right away at one of two remaining tables around 5:45PM.   <br><br>It took a bit for a server to take our order, but once the order was in our food came out fast.   The massaman curry was amazing!  The beef was extremely tender and the sauce was nicely balanced with coconut, spices and peanuts all working well together.    Prices were extremely reasonable, but just a heads up that rice is $3 extra which isn't prominently noted on the menu.   <br><br>I'd suggest double checking the bill before going up to pay; we were given someone else's and it was about $35 more than ours.  <br><br>I'd agree with others to not be put off by the line.   This is not a place where people come to linger for a long time; people are coming for excellent Thai food served quickly, so tables do turn quickly!</span>",4 star rating,"Sep 29, 2016","Indianapolis, IN"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">We always passed this restaurant on our way home and it was always so busy. We just had to see what the fuss was about!<br><br>I have never been to a restaurant which delivers your food order soo fast ! I'm not even kidding too. We were so surprised. Our waitress took our order through an app? And then we got all our food and drink in less than 6 minutes. This place was so packed and busy too so it was impressive. <br><br>There is nothing bad to say about our experience. Everything from the service to the quality of food, there was nothing to falter it. Everything was so yummy and the way that Thai food was supposed to be. The pricing of everything is so affordable too. Dishes are of good quantities that you can easily share between 2 people, and are under $20. <br><br>I have to say, as a tip: you're best off trying to get there before dinner rush because there was a line of people as we were heading out even after the 8:30 mark. <br><br>All in all, I'd go back to try everything else, and it would be a place I'd order takeaway from on a weekly basis!

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">You simply have to try the crispy pork, it's incredible! I also tried the curry puffs which were totally not oily which was a nice change from most places. The chicken pad Thai was delicious. Depending on what time you arrive you may have to wait but you just put your name down at the door, I was dining  alone and was seated almost immediately. Eftpos has a minimum $30 spend, that just meant I over ordered and happily have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. The restaurant is right around the corner from the Park Royal Darling Harbour so definitely give room service a miss and got to Home Thai!</span>",5 star rating,"Feb 6, 2018","Bridgeman Downs, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I've been meaning to write this review for days but haven't had a chance until now-- 6 days after eating here.  Truth be told, my mouth is still watering almost a week after visiting Home.<br><br>My boyfriend warned me there would be a line out front and there sure was.  Despite having at least 10 parties in front of us, the wait was actually fairly quick, maybe 20 minutes (which worked out well because FYI: this place is cash only and the wait gave us time to go to the ATM.)<br><br>Once we were seated, our food came quickly.  Everything was So.Damn.Good!  We got 2 appetizers-- the dim sum and the multicolored dumplings (I don't remember the name of these, but you'll know it when you see it on the menu).  My boyfriend ordered the mussamum curry, which he says is the best he's ever had, and I ordered the pad Thai, also the best I've ever had.  <br><br>Just go to Home right now.  You won't be sorry.</span>",5 star rating,"Dec 12, 2015","San Francisco, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I have not been to Thailand, and other than eating a fair bit of Thai food here and back in the US, I have no knowledge of technique or authenticity. However, I have eaten plenty of bad Thai food, but never at Home Thai. <br><br>I have been several times for lunch now, and am always impressed with how quickly they work through the line out the door.  It doesn't matter what you order it comes fresh and fast.  My noodles are never too greasy, and their milder dishes are just as flavorful as the spicier options.  I personally love the pad kee mao, but be warned, it packs a lot of kick. <br><br>I'm short everything I have eaten here has been delicious, you should bring cash for bills under $30, no split checks, and watch out for the heat on spicy dishes.</span>",4 star rating,"Dec 31, 2015","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I had pretty high expectations for Home Thai, but at the end of the day the entire experience fell a little short.<br><br>This place is full of energy, so if you're looking for a loud-ish joint where you can hear the conversations of people next to you, it's for you. It wasn't exactly what I had in mind.<br><br>Everyone I spoke with here was very helpful. And yet, I never fully feel like they understood exactly what I was looking for. I tried not to ask for too many recommendations or extra rice, but it was tough to explain even these things to most of the people working there.<br><br>It's all about the food at the end of the day, and the food here wasn't good or bad--it was 100% average. The pad thai could have been at a solid but unexceptional place in suburban NJ. The curries were flavorful but a little one-note. I was surprised at how deeply fried some of their food was and found it to kill a lot of the flavor.<br><br>If this was any other random restaurant, I'd have been ok about it. But a few people talked up Home, and in a city with tons of Thai food I wish I picked a place where I could either enjoy the food more, or enjoy food that had more complexity or subtlety to it.</span>",3 star rating,"Oct 29, 2017","New York, NY"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Some of my wife's friends introduced me to this amazing place for Thai food.  In terms of value for money it cannot be beat.  I would gladly pay more money for a meal from here, but I am extremely glad that it is so affordable.<br><br>The flavours of every dish I had really pop and I really cannot say I was ever disappointed with a menu selection.  Even though I love Thai curries, I never had one from here as I have always tried other dishes and been amazed.<br><br>If it is your first time, and you are a pork belly fan (lets be honest who isn't.... I mean I'm Jewish and I even love the pork belly).  This place makes the crispiest one I know of.  Sure it may be fatty, but its so damn good.  If you don't like it just take home as leftovers, send me an email and I will pick it up from your apartment.<br><br>But other than that I'd say get a salad (banana flower, papaya, or another as you cannot go wrong), the pork belly, and a few other dishes with some sticky rice and enjoy.   To finish up get the first item on the dessert menu.  It is some freshly fried dough and a coconut pandan sauce for dipping.  Great finish to a great meal.<br><br>By the way, I'd suggest going in a big group as it is the best way to try lots.</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 15, 2012","Deerfield, IL"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Home Thai is one of my all-time favourites but never thought of reviewing them. I went for lunch and they do have a different menu for dinner.<br><br>SOFT SHELL CRAB W/ MANGO SALAD (Pu Nim Yum Ma Mhung)<br>The crab is perfectly fried acting as the sweet and delicious protein in its own right. Its combination with the Mango salad just works for me. The balance of sweetness and acidity is just right. Textures did complement each other where the fresh veggies have a mix of soft and crunchy freshness with the fried soft shell crab giving the salad that crouton quality and warmth.<br><br>STIR FRIED CRISPY PORK BELLY W/ PIK KHING SAUCE ON RICE (Kao Rad Pik Khing Moo Grob)<br>One of my all-time favourites, there's just something about tender pork and crispy crackling that is  just so yummy but this dish is much more than that, I would describe it as sensory overload. The oil based sauce that comes with it is full of flavour (good mix for the white rice) and has that heat from the chilli giving that kick. The green beans are not just here as passengers - they are cooked al dente they are just the icing on the cake. <br><br>Good things have to be consumed in moderation, large servings would probably become sickening for some, a lunch portion that includes rice is just right to share for two.<br><br>SPICY SOFT BONE PORK SOUP (Tom Saab)<br>Amateurs of beef would love this,  it is pure beef soup but seasoned with Thai spices predominantly coriander. Although it looked like a generic Asian noodle soup, It does have its own unique personality and distinctively different from Chinese and Viet flavours that may be weird at first. Yum noodles and ultra tender chunky beef make this dish another alternative to pho this winter.<br><br>Conclusion<br>Before my first time at Home, I thought that Thai food only consisted of Pad Thai, green curry and Tom Yum flavours.

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">This place has build its self a reputation as one of Sydney's must visit eateries. Walking past on many occasions I couldn't help but be intrigued as to what it offers based on the crowds that lined up outside.<br><br>It was a Wednesday at approx 7:45 and it took us 45 minutes to get in. With a wait like that your hoping for something special. <br><br>We got seated, ordered and without much time to blink we got served our food. Papaya Salad , Masaman beef curry and spring rolls. <br><br>The spring rolls were vegetarian served with a sweet sauce. They were perfect as a starter. The Papaya salad was a combination of pork, peppers , cucumber and gorgeous crunchy crackers on the side. The salad was really good but oh so spicy . Perfect if your ready for it. Recommend having water on the table for this one . So good that despite the heat I kept eating it. <br><br>The curry was the perfect dish for taking breaks in between the spicy salad. The Masaman beef had big chunks of beef but it was really tasty so worked really well.<br><br>Just to overindulge opted to try the mango with sweet  rice. Tasty dish. The rice was coloured for fun and had a vanilla sauce over it and the mangos were very sweet. Nice dessert. <br> <br>Overall will be back again for sure . Staff were on point with getting people in and out as quickly as possible and the place has a good vibe with food to match .<br><br>Thumbs up .</span>",5 star rating,"Mar 25, 2015","Crows Nest, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Authentic or not, the food was delicious!<br><br>I loved the Soft Shell Crab and Mango Salad  so much that we ordered a second one after out meal! It had a perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and salty flavor. The soft shelled crap was fried to perfection.<br><br>The Pad Thai was also delicious, although back home I usually order chicken with my Pad Thai, the decision maker of our table ordered beef. There isn't much to write home about the beef and there were pieces left over. The actual Pad Thai was really well made, perfect chewiness and not soggy like some. Chili, peanuts, lemon, and sugar were placed on the side of the noodles for you mix to your taste. The dish also came with a lot if fresh bean sprouts.<br><br>Fresh spring rolls were done very well, the rice paper skin was soft but firm at the same time, however they do tend to fall apart when picked up. This is a nice light appetizer to share.<br><br>The Satay chicken was another great dish with large skewers of chicken paired with their satay sauce. Although they were large pieces of chicken breast, it was still not dry and tough.<br><br>My party also enjoyed the Banana Flower salad, it want my cup of tea but it was pretty fragrant and everyone else loved it.<br><br>We ordered three types of dessert. Oh we were on a food binge. This was for a party of four mind you. <br><br>Durian Sticky Rice - the worst dish of the night- super sweet and warm, an odd temperature, I'd stay away from this<br><br>Mango Sticky Rice was great. Both sticky rice dishes come with three types of sticky rice- pandan, coconut, and a dark colored one (not sure what it was).<br><br>Fried Breadsticks with Pandan coconut sauce was extremely fresh, we actually saw them dry the breadsticks in their open kitchen upstairs. The bread sticks are similar to donuts but lighter. Even when we were stuffed from dinner we managed to fit these in.<br><br>Verdict- great Thai place with wonderful flavors!! Must return.<br><br>Tip- go later in the evening or sit by the windows since it's really stuffy and hot with little ventilation other than the windows upstairs</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 12, 2014","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">This is my second favourite casual Thai restaurant in Sydney...I come a lot, and always recommend it over the other casual Thai restaurants. There's always a queue, but you never wait too long. The vibe is hip and the service is pretty good overall if they're not swamped, and you can easily feed two people for $20 each.<br><br>Their pad thai is a little different than other locations in that you can make it as sweet as you want, since it comes with a side of sugar. Pad see ew and pad khee mao are good, the stir fry pork belly dishes are all delicious, albeit taste somewhat similar...but still good. I love the massaman curry and duck curry as well. Shoot, everything is good!<br><br>If you can't handle spicy food that well I suggest you ask them to tone it down when you order.</span>",4 star rating,"Jan 21, 2013","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Saw a long line outside and thought ""this must be a good place to eat."" Then realised it was Thai.<br><br>So glad we waited, wasn't long maybe 20 mins. The food came out within 5 mins literally!! The place is so alive, you hear the dishes clincking, people talking, waiters rushing around like darts. <br><br>46.Massamun beef was really tasty, the beef just pulled apart so easily. 16.Herb pork stick and 17.fresh spring rolls were very tasty. 129.crispy pork belly was a little spicy but not too much, the crackle tasted so good.<br><br>The black ice tea was very very sweet. Like too too sweet.<br><br>Make sure to leave room for the mango sticky rice dessert.</span>",4 star rating,"Oct 12, 2013","Southbank, Melbourne, Australia"

This place has great food -- my favorite is green chicken curry.  Really nice and spiced as I like it!<br><br>There is always a line. The key is being patient you will get in soon enough. The number of Thai patrons should be a tip off of the quality of the food. Order a beer, if you get a spicy dish you will enjoy it that much more.</span>",5 star rating,"Jun 1, 2014","Frederick, MD"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">So, Australia isn't all barbies and beaches - Thai food is massive, and I just had to try some. <br><br>There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived, and the process was fairly simple; put your name on the list, how many in your party, and take a ticket. It was fairly windy outside, meaning there was a bit of a chill in the air, but the view into the kitchen kept us entertained for the duration of our wait.<br><br>We were seated upstairs, which was quite cozy, and settled in with some water. The wait to get our order taken was fairly lengthy, hence the 4 stars - I thought the rest was a 5 star experience. Once our order was taken (on an iPad nonetheless) the food came quickly and piping hot. <br><br>Everything comes at once and, as we later learned, supposed to be eaten 'family style', with everyone sharing their dishes, but you live and you learn! We tucked into a range of items; chicken satay, deep fried beef, pad thai, chicken and coconut soup, sticky rice, green curry, and beef and cashew nuts. The food started coming within moments of us ordering, and not all vegetables - spring onions etc - were completely cooked through, which was slightly disappointing. <br><br>The chicken and coconut soup was delicious, really creamy and filling, and with just the right amount of spice. Paired with properly sticky rice, with no need for a knife and fork, I was very happy with my Thai experience.</span>",4 star rating,"Jan 5, 2014","Manchester, United Kingdom"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I would say, for those of you who likes, ""hiiii...how was your food? Can I get you anything else?"" Or, modified Thai, don't come here. Just saying. Those of you you can't eat authentic, go to some-tang or some place else. It is Asian service, you're not gonna get a mothering service. I think most folks who think the service is no-so great, as Asian, we don't like to baby our people when they are eating. Not because they are rude, they just don't ask question every bite you take. This is all about the food, flavors, and true food lovers. <br><br>Now for the food, it is as good as it is in Thailand. It is full on hot, when you ask for hot. Full blast of flavors and not something you need to add more stuff to. Sure occasionally, there's mishaps, but so is any place else in this world. Just simply explain yourself. A coworker was charged for 2 items, a week ago I might add, but as we explained to them, they simply make the dish for him. <br><br>It gets really busy, so if you can arrived before 6 pm, it's great. They have their favorite and popular dish, but I'm always about the som tam, and curry. Be adventurous, and don't order just ""pad Thai"". Or fried rice. You're in great place, order and eat away. <br><br>Enjoy!</span>",5 star rating,"Jul 29, 2015","Earth, TX"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Okay, let me see, it's kind of overwhelming with this place. If you not a regular, or Thai, or Laotian. First the sum tum (papaya salad), comes in 3 versions, the regular with lime and fish sauce. If you're newbie, go with this one. The other two is for regulars or of natives, because the fish sauce can be a bit strong, which it doesn't bother me a bit. I chose the sum tum with raw crab. A few items were Chinese items, but modified to fit the restaurant, as in adding Thai sauces instead Chinese sauce, and it does make it better. Don't order the barramundi fish steam, as it is pre-frozen. If I knew that, I would of not ordered it. I figured it was a well-known fish in this part of Australia and considered a sea-bass of Asian countries so I thought it would be fresh. I felt bad ordering for my crew. And it took them from 5:55pm to 6:34 to get it to us too. Needless to say, it is a great place to try it out. Most dishes that we ordered were great. Maybe next time I can say more when I try different dishes.</span>",,,

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Good standard Thai for sure. Super quick service (you actually feel a bit rushed), very busy and crowded table space, but pretty tasty stuff. Nothing flash or very original, but a great choice for the basics you'd be in the mood for sometimes. Not for people who are looking for very spicy or unique dishes at all. <br><br>The other thing I will say is the vegetarian selection is very limited. Not uncommon, and 100% their prerogative, but probably wouldn't recommend for strict veggies. The language barrier with the staff (although they're very nice) makes it that much harder to figure out what's in things that aren't described on the menu.<br><br>They also won't split bills, and charge a 3-6% surcharge for using credit cards.</span>",3 star rating,"Dec 12, 2017","Toronto, Canada"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Solid 4 stars, good but not great Thai food.  Maybe I was expecting more out of Yelps top choice for Thai in Sydney.  Of the 7 dishes we ordered, everything was tasty but not overwhelming.  Food comes out really quick but otherwise a no frills place.  We had an early dinner around 445pm and by the time we finished, a line was forming so go early cause it's popular.</span>",4 star rating,"Nov 28, 2019","Austin, TX"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">If you can endure the wait, you're in for a treat! The line seemed the long, but the wait wasn't so since it seemed a lot of people gave up their place in line. The window display at the front of the restaurant reminds me of Ding Tai Fung because you can see them make certain appetizers and desserts - a very interesting show.<br><br>Crispy Pork Belly was too crispy to the point where I can't taste any pork with every bite. Both the meat and the skin are fried to a crisp. As much as people rave about this dish, I wouldn't recommend it. The sauce was good, the actual crispy pork was not.<br><br>The winners of the night were the soft shell crab salad and pad see Mao with beef. The crab was tasty and messed well with the slaw. The dressing was yummy, but there was a bit too much of it to the point where I was afraid the crispiness of the crab will be soften by the dressing. The pad see Mao was spicy and is definitely one of the better versions of this dish at the many places I've had it.<br><br>Custard sticky rice was not spectacular. Custard on top with sticky rice on the bottom was forgettable. The custard was too soggy and the different colored sticky rice just all tasted the same thanks probably to food coloring.<br><br>All in all, if I'm ever in Sydney again, I'll probably pay this place another visit.</span>",4 star rating,"Aug 31, 2016","Diamond Bar, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Was walking around in the city at 2pm, didn't know what to eat. <br>I've been longing to Home but every time I've been, theres been a long queue. But i thought maybe this time it would be easier to get a table, since it was 2pm and a weekday (and......table for 1 LOL *lonely*)<br>Got seated within 3 mins, still had to write my name on the waiting list tho haha. Always a queue there!!<br>Ordered a Pad Thai. This is my default dish to order at every Thai Restaurant. I just think that its necessary to order this staple so i can compare Pad Thai's. (I should just be a Pad Thai connoisseur tbh)<br>Well, Home. You were worth the wait, you were worth the times i walked away when i saw the queue. and now i know WHY theres a queue.<br>Pad Thai was 11/10 standout. It definitely has its own BANG to it, can't exactly point it out though. It is different to the Pad Thai at Chat Thai. I like how the Pad Thai at Home has the little mounds on sugar and some burning spicy spices. However, i underestimated how spicy the spices were, and just straight up ate a little and burned my oesophagus (where i then proceeded to scoop all the spicy spices off my dish, and mix in ALL the sugar provided)<br>Overall, gr8/10. Will be back soon :D</span>",5 star rating,"Apr 18, 2016","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Really good. 100% recommend if you're in the area.<br><br>The location is cool. It's in a very urban area of the city that has a lot of foot traffic. It looks small but is surprisingly big inside. Kitchen is visible from the restaurant and outside, I thought the street-view kitchen was cool. <br><br>Design and decor are modern and clean. The food is seriously good. We like spicy food and ordered everything a little spicier than what comes with the regular orders. Everything was amazing though. We ended up coming back again a few days later and will return during our next trip to Sydney!</span>",5 star rating,"Oct 20, 2017","Corona, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I've eaten here with the same group of friends twice now. It's undoubtedly my favourite Thai restaurant and definitely trumps many of my local Thai restaurants. I guess a testament to how great it is is how long it takes to line up for dinner here on a normal day. We spent about 15-20 mins standing outside each time since there's no booking of course, but it was definitely worth it.<br><br>If you're ever here, order the crackling pork belly with some steamed rice to share with a couple of others - you'll love it, I promise! The service is incredibly fast as well and all our orders seemed to come out within 5-10 mins of us ordering it. Remarkable considering that the entire restaurant was packed and there were groups still waiting outside to eat at 9pm. The prices are pretty reasonable, too. A group of 4 of us had dinner there and we amassed about $30 a head and felt stuffed afterwards.<br><br>However, if you're a vegan like one of my friends was, this may not be your favourite place. There aren't many good options that we found for her so I wouldn't recommend you come here for that.<br><br>Basically, I'm giving this place a huge yes. Do I recommend this place? Yes. Will I eat here again? Yes. Would I wait half an hour to eat here again? Definitely yes.</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 23, 2016","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Cheap Thai, ok flavours but the ambience is not pleasant. <br><br>Queues forming at a restaurant for both lunch and dinner means a restaurant is probably good, but I feel that the flavours and the ambience do not justify the visit. <br><br>The flavours are more authentic than the average local Thai restaurant but I don't love it, it tastes average. <br><br>As for ambience, guests are expected to queue up for 20mins then be crammed in any available spot, meaning you'll be literally rubbing elbows with strangers and of course you'll need to awkwardly balance your bag on your lap (the chairs have no backs) while making sure the sauce doesn't spill onto your clothes or belongings.</span>",3 star rating,"Jan 20, 2016","Cherrybrook, Australia"

It doesn't take a genius to know this is a must try because for months I've always seen a line of people waiting every time. Place was amazing. Fish was so fresh it practically melted in my mouth.

And people know it because there is always a queue, no matter what time it is. <br>I've been here twice for lunch and dinner respectively and both were great experiences. For lunch I just had a pad thai which was nice, with a thai milk tea. For dinner I had the pad thai again, plus the pork belly with chilli which was fatty but good.  But the thing I loved the most was the dessert which was a thai fried donut which you dip in condensed milk and pandan sauce. It was almost like churros but asian style!<br>Definitely recommend.</span>",4 star rating,"Oct 26, 2011","Sydney, Australia"

Line can get really long, but once you're inside the service is so fast. Expect your food to arrive within 5 mins of ordering. We ordered the soft shell crab with mango salad. Absolutely delicious, the flavour was so divine! We also got the Pad prik khing, as did half the restaurant upon observation, and again we weren't disappointed. Just wait till you grab their dessert menu! This place is the full set, absolutely my favourite casual dining place.</span>",5 star rating,"Mar 11, 2016","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">You guys are getting sloppy. Quality is going down hill. Used to be my favorite, but you skipped the cherry tomatoes in my pork salad. It tasted salty?! The flavors were hot bland over spicy flavor. I can tell you've cheapened it up a bit more with the portion of meats, less in massaman curry and papaya salad wasn't good as it used to be.. no color and vibrancy like it was before. This used to be the best place for Thai in Sydney.. but I have other go to's now. Fix it and I'll rate it up again.</span>",2 star rating,"Oct 19, 2018","Sydney, Australia"

We started with a Thai iced tea (standard flavor), KEUW TIEW LOD (vegetarian rolls) and the corn. The rolls were excellent and a unique flavor, the corn was also really good but not exactly Thai in my opinion, but tasty  nonetheless. For our entrees we got the fried pork (didn't personally eat it but was told it was very good) and the STIR FRIED CHILLI BASIL W/ RICE with chicken..I thought it was really fishy tasting and couldn't eat it. Overall great place to try.</span>",4 star rating,"Mar 25, 2016","Ormond Beach, FL"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">G'day mates! Today was my first time in Sydney and I was dying to try this place. It was about 6pm on a Sunday and the line was already out the door. We waited about 6 or 7 minutes to be seated at a table for two. The service was not great, (maybe because they are always so busy) but it wasn't bad either. Mediocre at best. Chicken satay as an appetizer with peanut sauce. The flavors were great but the meat was a little overcooked. I had the salmon salad as my meal and it was cooked perfectly; very rare for me to have salmon at the perfect meat temperature. The salad has a nice kick to it. The mango sticky rice is to die for! Overall it was a great experience!</span>",4 star rating,"Jul 9, 2016","Baltimore, MD"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Oh, how I love home, but it makes me cry.  Literally.  I love spicy food and will mnuch away on fresh jalapenos.  I even tried a Naga Jolokia once, which is rated at 1 million scoville units.  I spit it out after chewing it up as I have watched people get convulsions from swallowing one.  But Home's chicken larb has me crying like a group of teenage girls watching a double feature of Titanic and The Notebook.  Frankly, I would be crying too if I had to watch that double feature but for the several hours wasted from my life...<br><br>Anyways, Home.  I really think some of the best Thai in Sydney and, after living in Newtown where it is a city ordinance to have at least 50% of all restaurants be Thai, I think I know what I am talking about.

Joy!) and number 12 (Dried beef)  yes the ones that look like dried cat poo's please.<br><br>They've posted some rather helpful pictures for the language morons like myself but even vastly more intelligent people then myself who venture off into the un-pictured territory of the menu have said how much the enjoy the food. <br><br>Just go now immediately write your name on the clipboard out the front take ya number it won't take long.</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 28, 2012",Australia

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">This place ALWAYS has a lineup outside .. and now I realize why. <br><br>For a newcomer to Sydney, it's important to note that Thai restaurants are ... of no shortage. Kinda like sushi restaurants to Vancouver, there's probably hundreds and hundreds (no exaggeration). I think the difference between them is ... well, quality and price, naturally. There's a ton of fast-food type joints, where you can get a pad thai, pad see ew plate for under ten bucks. This would be roughly thrown together. On the contrary, you can hit up Sailor Thai or Spice I Am for a significantly higher price .... and there, you'll see the price and quality. <br><br>Home is in between in price. Not bad in quality. <br><br>Also not the best service, but maybe it's because they know they have line ups around the block. That, and this is not a tip-based country.<br><br>I had a som tam thai (a staple of mine when I lived in Thailand) -- it wasn't bad. Not too spicy and enough dressing. The curry was pretty thick. The crispy pork belly and greens is a tad spicy. Pad Thais (regular and with thin vermicelli) isn't the best I've had ... but not the worse. There's also the mango and sticky rice dessert .... really good. And another dessert with taro. <br><br>Would I come back and line up forever outside? Definitely no. But if you come a before closing, 9:30 ish, you can get a seat pretty quick.</span>",4 star rating,"Jan 24, 2013","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I think Thai food has become my favourite asian cuisine, (with Japanese being a strong 2nd), and 'Home Thai Restaurant' has hit a home run. Brought one of my best mates along with me for dinner at this awesome restaurant and it didn't disappoint, everything was near perfect; the service, the friendliness of the staff, atmosphere and most importantly the food! The menu you read from had photos of the food you were about to order, so you knew exactly what you were getting. When the food hit the table, our jaws dropped, because what we saw in front of us was exactly like the photos in the menu (which is rare) and they looked and smelled absolutely amazing! Mind you, the whole place gave off a nice aroma. My mate has very high expectations when it comes to food and he was in love with the place... now that's saying something ;) <br><br>Honestly please try this place out. Grab your friends, lovers, sisters, brothers, dads, mums, cousins etc. and give this Thai restaurant a go, it won't fail you.</span>",5 star rating,"May 12, 2013","Sydney, Australia"

The dishes are all bursting with flavour and character (though not traditionally authentic Thai, they are still mighty delicious).<br><br>The food arrives very quickly though you may have to wait in line for a while to get a table! They don't take bookings here so you best get in early.<br><br>Stand out dishes include the crispy pork belly, pad see ew and massamun beef curry. For dessert, you can't go past the ""bread sticks with custard"", which is a light and pillowy deep fried pastry served with a pandan custard dipping sauce.</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 7, 2016","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Based on a couple recommendations and the yelp reviews a few coworkers and I visited Home Thai on our last business trip to Australia.  I can definitely say this is the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand!<br><br>One thing I learned in Thailand is that the food only takes a few minutes to actually cook (prep is another story) and this place delivers on that.  The servers enter your order on a tablet and your food has arrived a few minutes later.  So, don't be scared off by the line as tables turn over quick. <br><br>Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for great Thai food in Sydney.</span>",5 star rating,"Nov 12, 2014","Redwood City, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Quick, delicious, would definitely come back.<br><br>The food is quick, service is fast &amp; with error (they gave our food to another table, and gave us food from a different table), they seat people quickly despite long lines.  <br><br>The food is legitimately spicy but worth the pain.  The Thai milk tea wasn't that good but the food made up for it.  Chose this place because of positive yelp reviews, and the reviews were right on.<br><br>The brick walls give a nice fireplace feel.  Casual and higher middle class feel for reasonable prices.  Although fish is pretty expensive at $35 range.  The open kitchen that allows you to watch how things are cooked builds trust and is entertaining while you wait to be seated.  With the staff being all Asian, it feels authentic.</span>",4 star rating,"Feb 8, 2015","Denver, CO"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Home Thai is seriously one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been too. I lived in Australia for about 3 months and could not find good Thai until this place. The atmosphere here is very cozy and inviting, servers are typical Thai people and very nice.  The food is prepared right in front/behind you depending where you sit in a large open kitchen set up on the 1st(main) floor. The ingredients are fresh, they properly alter the spiciness and the meat is cooked just perfect. <br><br>My favorite dish here was the Pad See Ew, a combination of noodles, rice, seasoning, chicken and spicyness! Just delicious. Although I have had multiple things on the menu and all are good, I have never been disappointed. Only downfall about this place is people are starting to catch on to its awesome nature and therefore have started creating lines when I go here. To avoid waiting you can also get take out or pay by credit card which takes all of 10 minutes for those of you i a rush.<br><br>If you are looking for authentic Thai in Sydney this is hands down the place to go. It just doesn't get any better then this, not even in the USA. After eating here I will have to go to Thailand to see if their food can compete!</span>",5 star rating,"Apr 23, 2014","Dallas, TX"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I'm a regular here eating nearly once a week either for lunch or dinner. Quality of food is always good particularly for the single rice and noodle dishes. Big fan of both the pad Thai dishes on offer here. Service is usually good but on occasion when the restaurant is really busy it can get a bit messy and waiter service can be slow and impolite (eg I've had them spill water n my iPhone or me a few times). For the price you pay the food quality is really good. I would also recommend the pork belly rice dishes. That being said I think the curry here is not as good as their other dishes and have tried a few but been let down. If you want decent duck curry or something for under $20 then go up to Holy Bassil. <br><br>Only thing to be mindful of is the line can get long during peak times eg weekday lunches and Friday night so you  need to get a ticket and line up outside- failing to pay attention closely can result in you losing your spot when they call your number!</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 13, 2013","Pyrmont, Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">A girly catch up brought us to ""Home"" Thai restaurant for dinner.  I find their choice of restaurant name quite interesting as every time someone asked me which restaurant I was going to for Friday night dinner I'd reply with ""Home"" and be met with a puzzled ""but you said you were going out for dinner"" look on people's faces.<br><br>I've been past home many times but the queue outside always deters me from trying it out.  This time though I wrote my name on the wait list and patiently stood in line for 40mins.  I found the open plan kitchen quite interesting as it gives you some comfort that the cooks aren't doing the dodgy with your food.  It also gives you something to do whilst waiting in line, although staring at people making food that isn't yours can be a bad thing when you're hungry.<br><br>FOOD<br>Tonight for our mains we ordered the Soft Shell Crab with Mango Salad ($16.50), Pad C Ew Chicken ($10.90) and the Stir Fried Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli ($14.50).<br><a href=""http://www.yelp.com.au/biz_photos/C9vqxligvlBv6wGRigdYpg?select=UBQoVGvpWVpkEfHfcGl_Lg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.yelp.com.au/biz_photos/C9vqxligvlBv6wGRigdYpg?select=UBQoVGvpWVpkEfHfcGl_Lg</a><br><br>The salad was delicious.  The crab was fresh and crispy whilst the salad complimented it well.  The salad was not as hot as the papaya salad but still full of spicy and sour flavours.  Whilst Pad C Ew is my all time favourite Thai noodle dish I'm not sure if anyone could ever make one that would make my mouth water.  Home ticks all the right taste buds and managed to satisfy me but not so much because of anything special they did to the dish but rather they didn't do anything wrong with the dish.  In terms of the pork belly I've only ever really eaten asian pork belly served on its own and so found it being served with chinese broccoli an interesting combination.  Whilst the pork belly itself was not as fatty as I had expected it to be the dish was stir fried with quite a bit of oil that made the vegetables look a little saturated in oil.  An additional thing to note is that we had 3 people and so ordered 2 servings of rice but what came out looked more like something that would have served 4 people.  Very generous indeed!<br><br>After watching one of the cooks deep frying these sticks for 40mins whilst we were waiting to be seated, we decided to try them for dessert and so ordered the Fried Bread Sticks ($5.00).  This bread sticks tasted exactly like the ones I use to eat with congee so it was interesting to try this as a dessert dipped in pandan custard sauce.  The bread sticks are all freshly deep fried and so nice and crunchy on the outside whilst soft and fluffy on the inside.  I would have liked the pandan custard sauce to have had a stronger pandan flavour though.<br><a href=""http://www.yelp.com.au/biz_photos/C9vqxligvlBv6wGRigdYpg?select=SBxkdV7pIwceYj1Qe_ZomQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.yelp.com.au/biz_photos/C9vqxligvlBv6wGRigdYpg?select=SBxkdV7pIwceYj1Qe_ZomQ</a><br><br>SERVICE<br>Waitstaff that take your orders with iPads and carry around LV bags (yet to confirm the genuineness of these bags but my bet is on fake) need I say more?!  For a busy restaurant with a high turnover there were enough people around to make sure we weren't waiting for our order to be taken or water to be refilled or food to be served.  Whilst the wait outside was long the wait inside inside wasn't and everything was smooth and efficient.  I also liked the fact that they repeated your order back to the table to avoid any mistakes being made.<br><br>VERDICT<br>Thai seems to be the trendy cuisine in Sydney of late with a sizable number of Thai restaurants located in the city alone.  Home manages to provide a satisfying meal at a very affordable price which is obviously evident by the popularity the restaurant has gained in the short period of time it has been in operation.  I would definitely return to this restaurant to try more dishes but only on another day where I have the patience to wait in line.</span>",4 star rating,"Dec 11, 2011","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Really good, but oh so very hot, Hot, HOT! The chicken larb is so spicy here that I can't tolerate it, but my husband love it. But if spicy isn't your thing, there are other options. The beef salad is very good and nowhere near the spiciness of some of the other dishes.</span>",4 star rating,"Jan 19, 2013","Las Vegas, NV"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">This was our first time @HomeThai and won't be our last. We arrived mid-week around 19:00 and despite a dozen people waiting on the footpath for takeaway, we were seated immediately.<br>The menu is a wonderful mix of authentic dishes, some I have never tried before. I find it enlightening  to taste new mixtures of ingredients. One was the green papaya salad with fermented crabs...not for those who don't like a sweet/salty papaya combination with the crunch of small whole seasoned crabs, white cabbage, bean sprouts and snake beans. Yum !<br>We also had a green chicken curry that was succulent and spicy. Eaten with pineapple fried rice, another new dish. <br>It is a large restaurant with split level seating &amp; lots of hard industrial features. If not for an excessive amount of noise, this is really a 5 star Thai restaurant. Very reasonably priced, a tasty selection of over 50 dishes, with a good choice of Asian beers.<br>Quick friendly service. <br>Highly recommended.</span>",4 star rating,"Sep 13, 2017","Cable Beach, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Over priced or got the wrong bill. I had to wait 20 mins for a table for 1 last night.  Expect long lines. There's a bad twist to how busy thIs place is which I will explain later. When I initially got the tab of $52 from one of the 4 waitresses working the tables I thought it was a bit high  for my $40 meal.  But, being from the USA I figured it must be due to the local taxes and didn't want to raise a ruckus.  After getting back to my hotel I soon realized from  a local that all Auzi taxes are include in the price.  Oh no! I managed to find my restaurant receipt and found out that the waitress mistakenly gave me someone else's tab.  It showed 3 diners and had an extra entree and rice.  The meal was good, but, is it worth the long wait and getting overcharged?  Nope.  I believe the staff who gave me the wrong bill  was due to the busy night.  I hope management takes a look at my receipt attached and tell the waitress who handled my bill to be more careful next time because it can really piss off some customers.</span>",1 star rating,"Dec 2, 2019",Location

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Popped in close to close time on a Saturday night, probably to be the last ones served, and enjoyed the speedy service and great fresh tasting Thai. <br><br>We were initially seated next to a cash register that popped out centimeters from my head whenever bills were being settled (punishment for coming in close to close?) but we moved ourselves somewhere more comfortable when it opened up and they were fine with that.  <br><br>The size of the beef pieces in the Massaman curry was crazy big - not what I'm used to. and was dubious at first but luckily the quality was good. Likewise my mate got the salmon which just looked like a cut of fish dumped in sauce, but the salmon had soaked up all the spicy juices perfectly. Both nice surprises. <br><br>The house wine was about what you'd expect from house wine. There wasn't a bottle-o super-close by so we were stuck with it - recommend you make sure to bring something nice with you if you want a decent drop, otherwise Home Thai is a great choice for Thai in the CBD, and pretty darn cheap for a night eating out in Sydney!</span>",4 star rating,"Oct 31, 2014","Melbourne, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Yum! Home was a super yummy Thai place that I was pleased to get to eat at while here in Sydney! The ambiance was warm and friendly with small tables groups relatively close together. This is not a place for a large group at least from what I could see, however there were upper areas that I could not see from where we were seated.<br><br>We were seated almost immediately, and our server came by almost as fast. As our first time here we need a moment to decide but once we did she appeared quickly once more and was ready to take our order. We got the pork belly, the pad c ew, the pork dumplings, and the prawn cakes all to share. We also each got a glass of sauvignon blanc. The pork dumplings came within 3 minutes, it was shocking the speed of service. I had heard good things about them so I was very excited. They were good, but definitely not what I was expecting. They had a thick consistency in the middle, and the filling was definitely more sweet than savory. They didn't come with a dipping sauce of any sort, which was fine, but I was just not expecting such a sweet start to dinner. The prawn cakes and pork belly came next also within 5 minutes of getting the dumplings. The pork belly delicious and crisp, almost to the point where I was worried I was eating something I wasn't supposed to be. It was excellent hot. I tried the prawn cakes next, and they were good as well. They came with a nice sauce and were nicely crispy on the outside with a yummy middle. Finally our Pad C Ew came, and I was honestly expecting it to be a bit spicier, but it was extremely mild, delicious, but certainly mild (and I am usually a 1 star max kind of spice girl). The sauce on that was really good, and the chicken was cooked absolutely perfectly. There was not one bite that I did not enjoy of it. <br><br>Overall the service here is super fast, this is not a place to bring a large group or to hangout for a long period of time in, and the food is delicious, although the dumplings are on the sweeter side.<br><br>Yum!</span>",5 star rating,"Jun 8, 2017","Seattle, WA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">My friend got the chili basil rice which was good but the massaman beef curry was disappointing. Super hard meat, obviously overcooked and the sauce was strangely milky sweet. I ordered it because the reviews on here said it was great but 10/10 would not recommend getting it. Maybe I got a shitty order but I'd say stick with the noodles or rice.</span>",4 star rating,"Nov 4, 2016","Seattle, WA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it. Got there on the early side of dinner as we read that there would be a long queue. Got there and put our name down and were able to get a table within 15 min. We ordered the Pad Se Ew and a ginger chicken dish. The pad se ew was the best I've ever had. The ginger chicken dish was flavorful but we didn't realize that there would be so much chicken and not much else. Would've been better over rice. Overall we had a good dinner there though and next time I'd just order a second noodle dish or curry dish instead of the chicken.</span>",4 star rating,"Aug 14, 2016","San Francisco, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Pretty good Thai food for the area. I only ordered food to go since it was close to the hotel that I was staying at. Called in my order and picked it up like 5-10 minutes later. I ordered the pork belly with green beans which was delicious but a little spicy. Also ordered the chicken curry which was good. I think they both came with white rice. Both time that I was there to pick up my food, there's was no line and it was super fast. Would definitely come here again.</span>",4 star rating,"Jul 16, 2014","Oakland, CA"

Food is still very good but I miss the salmon and duck curry which was very different than their regular curries. They charged me $3 for using my cc on a $23 bill. The feel has changed as well. Just not as much energy. Don't think I'll be coming back as often.</span>",3 star rating,"May 4, 2017","Carlsbad, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Very popular place with the locals and the tourists. Found this place through Yelp. Ordered the pork belly which is one of their signature dishes. The dish was full of flavor. Don't be alarmed by the crunchiness which took me off guard at first. Great dish to share but might be too much for just 1-2 people. Also ordered the Chicken pad Thai. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. Would definitely come back.</span>",4 star rating,"Nov 30, 2016","Huntington Beach, CA"

Loaded with flavor; I liked the contrast between the nuttiness and sweetness of the Kao Kreab, and the tangy, peppery sauce used in the Dim Sim was outstanding. <br><br>Fast service, almost brusque.

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">We went here for dinner. There was a rain storm that day and the restaurant was crowded with many people waiting too. Fortunately we got our table fast. The service was efficient too. For appetizer, we had curry puff which was sweet and spring rolls which had raw vegetables and tasted different than the fried ones which we have tried at other places. Did not enjoy the spring rolls. For the main course we had stir fry of fat noodles with vegetables and pad thai with vegetables. They were both good and had decent portions.</span>",5 star rating,"Feb 25, 2019","New York, NY"

You know you found the place when you see the crowd outside.  The wait wasn't bad for a Friday night approximately 20 minutes or so for a table of 2.  Looking inside it was a happening place and the wait staff are working hard.  Had the chicken pad Thai, roasted pork belly and fried squid.  Everything was delicious the squid was spicy but in a good way.  It was the type of spicy that lingers for awhile.   Food comes out amazingly fast. We enjoyed eating here.</span>",5 star rating,"Nov 2, 2015","Middle Village, NY"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">If I had written this review during our first visit to Home, it would have been 4 stars.  Maybe there were just stars in our eyes when we found a restaurant we could actually afford to eat in, since prices of everything are astronomical all over Australia.<br><br>We found it by chance, walking by at lunchtime, and tons of people were waiting outside for tables.  But the first time we went around 9:30, and there was no wait for a table.  On that visit, with not so many diners combining their collective body heat with that of the open kitchen, the impossibly small table was not as unbearable as the subsequent visit.  And the noise was moderate, the staff friendlier.<br><br>We started with a Tom Kha chicken soup.  I thought the kitchen had made a mistake, and I missed the coconut milk, but the hostess/waitress pointed out (gently) that it was my mistake.  No matter, since we'd have the coconut milk in the Red Curry with Beef, and the soup was delicious without it.<br><br>The Red Curry was soooo spicy, and I said to my husband ""Gee, we forgot to ask for it medium.""  Said hostess overheard, and it was MILD. ""I always order it mild for non-Asians,"" she said, grinning.  And that's when I realized that in the U.S. we don't get authentic Thai food; it's dumbed-down for Americans!  But despite the heat, it was delicious, even though I went through half a box of Kleenex trying to eat with my nose running.  The other dish, the usually ordinary Pad Thai, helped too, along with the generous portion of jasmine rice that's sold separately. <br><br>Returning to Sydney at the end of our trip, we craved Home's food, so we went back.  This time it was much earlier in the evening, and there was a long line.  But not a long wait.  Apparently, a bunch of groups gave their names, then left, so we were seated just a few minutes later.  But the vanishing outside crowd didn't translate to a comfy experience inside, where every table was filled the whole time.  The heat (if the A.C. was on, it couldn't compete), the noise, and the postage-stamp table made the whole meal a jarring experience.  Since all dishes are served nearly at once, it's no fun trying to fit the various dishes onto such a small space.  And this time we didn't order soup, just the two dishes and rice.  Oh, and two glasses of wine, which we didn't realize they had last time.  The couple next to us, on a first date, ordered half the menu - he must have been trying to impress her - and it was comical to see their table piled up like an episode of Hoarders.  <br><br>We ordered Massamun Curry with Beef, and it was gross.  The thick chunks of meat (with one potato, all swimming in a ton of soupy curry) were 99% fat, and we couldn't stand to look at it, let alone try it.  The same hostess suggested we change it for something that had sliced beef, such as red curry.  Since we didn't remember that that's what we'd ordered the previous time, we did.  And so we ended up with the identical meal both times, skipping the soup.  <br><br>It's easy to combine the two reviews into one and come up with a combined star rating.  Go, but go late, and stick to sliced meat, unless you love to eat all that blubber.</span>",3 star rating,"Dec 2, 2013","Las Vegas, NV"

We had massaman curry with beef and panang curry with salmon. Both were fabulous, though highly spiced. We also enjoyed fresh spring rolls and dim sum. If it wasn't our last night in Sydney we'd probably go back again. It was one of our best meals while on vacation in Australia, even compared to much higher end restaurants. We went early (5:30) on a Sunday evening and only had to wait a few minutes, and had fun watching the kitchen prepare all the food through the large windows out front while we waited. There was quite a line by the time we finished eating. Staff was attentive and pleasant, although very busy and rushing around.</span>",4 star rating,"Jun 15, 2014",Location

There was quite a line by the time we finished eating. Staff was attentive and pleasant, although very busy and rushing around.</span>",4 star rating,"Jun 15, 2014",Location

There's always a big crowd of people waiting for a table at lunch and dinner time, so come early or at odd hours if you don't want to queue. My favourite dishes here are the panang curry with salmon, the roasted duck curry, the pad thai and the yum hua plee salad (shredded banana flower with prawns, chicken, shallots, coriander, chilli and a heap of other yummy stuff). The desserts are terrific too and ridiculously cheap - about $5 each. Service is fast and friendly.</span>",5 star rating,"Aug 26, 2012",Australia

They only offer curry dishes at 4:00 PM.  He said he'd give it to us but when it came, it was barely edible as it was full of slivers of red peppers.  Guess he showed us.  No check on us after.  We even had to approach him to pay the bill.  Nice place...but snooty waiter.</span>",3 star rating,"Sep 30, 2012","Granville Island/False Creek, Vancouver, Canada"

Very good variety of food, didn't wait more than 5 minutes for our meals. The alcohol is very cheap as well compared to most city bars. It's easy to walk past though, so keep your eyes peeled at the entrance to the street.</span>",5 star rating,"Apr 11, 2013","Sydney, Australia"

I ordered Larb, one of my favorites..A little bummed that they wanted to charge me almost $3 for rice. Rice usually comes with Larb especially if you are charging me over $9 for it...I did not like that. Food was great, I recommend mango + sticky rice for dessert.</span>",4 star rating,"Mar 21, 2012","San Francisco, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Worst service ever in my life. They treat customers very badly. I have visited this place today for lunch and after waiting for 15 mins , we got the table . We ordered the food and when the food arrived, we asked for more additional tissues and a spare straw. The waitress is very rude and she didn't care to give the straw in the hand. We understood that it is busy time , so we went and got the tissue and the straw by ourselves . When the food arrived we went to the front desk to ask some soya sauce as the food is too bland..and she strikes again with her rude behaviour shouting at me for asking additional tissues and straw. I don't understand what was her problem. The other waitresses also supported her and showed us the door asking us to get out of the restaurant . This shows how rude their behaviour is. I never saw any restaurant in Sydney asking customers to leave the restaurant until and unless they physically handle people.When I insisted them that I want talk to the manger they said he is not available ... please think twice before you go to this place... I will never ever go to this place again in my life and so as my friends and colleagues in my office ..</span>",1 star rating,"Apr 8, 2019","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">This was listed as one of the best Thai restaurants in Sydney - so I wanted to give it a try.  When I saw the crowd waiting outside for seats I was kind of excited (usually the sign of a good restaurant).  In the end, it was decent enough - but not tremendously special.  My appetizer (or entree) was the Kao Kreab Pak Mhor - a little dumping purse of veggies and tofu.  That was actually quite interesting, though I was a bit confused as they brought it out well after my main.  For my main I had Pad Kee Mao.  It was perfectly good and well spiced - but not unlike anything I could get in Chicago at any decent Thai restaurant.  The prices were perfectly reasonable, particularly for Sydney, but I was a little put off when I asked if I could take my leftovers to go and they wanted to charge me $.50 for the container.</span>",3 star rating,"Jul 29, 2012","Chicago, IL"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">When we first arrived there was already a long line but we waited because we heard that this Thai place is suppose to be awesome.  Waited for a long time and we finally got inside. We sat down and we just looked at each other because they didn't give us a menu to look at or any water. The hostess just sat us down with nothing. Then we asked a waitress for some menus and water. Then she asked ""oh you guys don't have it yet?"" Well duh we don't have any that's why I asked! Then we ordered our food...we wanted chicken meatball but the waitress order us fried chicken. We told her that we didn't ordered it but the waitress insisted that we did. So we took it anyways. All of our food came out and we began to eat. Then I peer over and saw the waitress talking to another waitress and she looked at our table. I felt like she was talking behind our backs. If she has problem please tell it to my face. I don't appreciate what the waitress did. Food was good but the service sucks. Will not be coming back or recommend.</span>",2 star rating,"Aug 5, 2015","Oklahoma City, OK"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">My wife and I visited Home Thai a couple nights ago. The ambience in the restaurant is lively and it had a decent vibe. When we ordered off the menu we asked about the difference between two meals as they were listed exactly the same. The waitress explained that one was spicy and the other was not. We explained that we would like the non-spicy dish and if she could bring a little spice on the side that would be great. She agreed. Once we received our dishes - the dish that was supposed to be non-spicy was very very hot. You should understand that we are used to eating spicy food so we don't have a problem with spiciness - the only reason we didn't risk it is because one of the reviews we read said that the spiciness at this restaurant can be crazy. We took the first bite and attempted to send the dish back. I kid you not the waitress refused to take it back. She apologized that it was too spicy but her solution was that we should other a second one and then mix them together so it is not as spicy and she would ensure that the second dish had no spice. Umm what? We declined that option and shared the one dish that was not spicy. Upon return to the table she told us that she would remove the dish from the bill as we did not eat it and it was not what we ordered. We asked for the bill and she advised us to pay on our way out which was 20 feet away from where we were sitting. At the cashier the bill had both dishes - We explained to the cashier that one was supposed to be removed. She went back to the waitress who had cleared our table in 3 seconds - the waitress told her we ate the dish. This really ticked us off - at this point it was not about the money but the principle and we explained that to the cashier. The cashier quickly offered to take 50% off at which point steam was probably coming out of my ears so we paid and exited the restaurant. Funny enough on the walk back to our hotel another couple who was at the restaurant shared that they had a similar experience. I'm not sure if this is a tourist trap or its just the way they conduct business. The one meal we had was decent but the experience was horrible and put a bad taste in our mouth in what was otherwise an excellent visit to Sydney. So in short - stay away!</span>",1 star rating,"May 25, 2018","San Diego, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">unfortunately my husband reacts to msg (ajinomoto), which is a flavor enhancer not normally used in Thai food.  We thought we were safe in a Thai restaurant, but, to be safe, we talked with the waitress about his reaction , and the waitress, kindly, changed our order to avoid any possibility of msg.  <br><br>We are currently in the emergency room, because he has a very bad reaction to the food.  Despite the waitress' assurance, the cooks avoided all flavoring EXCEPT msg.  <br><br>My food was bland.  His was bland, but it contained msg, even though we specified no msg and even though we said he was so allergic he needed to go to the hospital.<br><br>We will avoid Home in the future. <br><br>Service was good except for the msg confusion.

The portions are large and the 4 star rating holds true as some things are quite not on par with Thai but all in all a pretty good value for Sydney dining. Spicy basil chicken was good and dessert with shaved ice was lacking flavor.</span>",4 star rating,"Feb 6, 2024","San Clemente, CA"

We tried to change the order since the waitress forgot a dish, but we couldn't. We ordered chicken Pad Thai and seafood glass noodle Pad Thai with 2 beers and a wine.<br>The meal came at different times, so m wife had nearly finished her meal when I received mine. Quality and quantity was good - with a lot of noodles.<br>The cost for 2 came to $75 which is relatively good value</span>",4 star rating,"Feb 22, 2024","Portishead, United Kingdom"

It took us half an hour to get a table but it was well worth the wait.  The food was delicious and redolent with Thai spices - lemongrass, chilli, galangal and coriander.  The tom yum with giant king prawns was outstanding and we loved our mango sticky rice dessert.</span>",5 star rating,"Nov 6, 2019","Bulimba, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I usually love exploring different restaurants when I'm traveling... with that said, I happily came here twice within a week.  <br><br>Some of their dishes, i.e. Som Tum, come in a HUGE portions, while I could've done with helpings more of their curry dishes i.e. their sweet Penang Curry.  Their Pad Thai was another HUGE dish that was delicious and served with the traditional sides of sugar, chili, and peanuts. My colleagues and I barely had enough room on the table for all the dishes we ordered (and shared family style).  <br><br>I loved everything that was ordered with the exception of the Tamarind Sauce Fish. Other than that, let your happy self go wild. <br><br>Home Thai is one of the best Thai restaurants I've eat at outside of Thailand. Jing jing.</span>",5 star rating,"Mar 29, 2018","Chicago, IL"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">As others have stated, Home Thai Restaurant is a sprawl of culinary efficiency that's become a hot spot in Sydney, and while I developed a tremendous amount of respect for their speed and friendliness, I wasn't particularly blown away by their iteration of my all-time favorite Thai Dish Panang Curry.<br><br>Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?<br><br>By Sydney Restaurant standards, Home Thai has some serious real estate, and they fill the space with some pretty high density seating. While you won't be knee to knee or elbow to elbow with your neighbors, you'll be able to hear every word they say, so maybe find a different location for an intimate date.<br><br>However, if you're fine with some close quarters, you can sit back and watch the smooth efficiency with which Home Thai is run. Yes, the queue can grow long, but they burn through it quickly and from there can easily have your food out five minutes post order. It's all very impressive. Star.<br><br>Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?<br><br>There's great value to be had at Home Thai. Good sized curry dishes are priced as low as $12.00 AUD, which is blissfully cheap especially if you're coming from the States with a very advantageous exchange rate. Star. <br><br>Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?<br><br>My Panang Curry had all the potential in the world with the right mix of fresh ingredients and some fluffy accompanying jasmine rice. However, the consistency was a bit of a strike, with a more watery than creamy textures and a flavor profile that didn't quite pop in the way that I typically expect any yellow curry to do. Single Star. <br><br>Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?<br><br>Home Thai is a great experience, but their dishes fall a bit short of other Thai I've had.

First of all, the environment is noisy<br>It's strange that you can't call the waiter to order<br>They can't even count the money wrong. They added a bowl of rice 4.5dollars and gave her 20. She wrote 10dollars and then gave me five dollars and five... Then they told her that she only paid me ten dollars. Is it possible for the waiter to charge more money for the restaurant without paying attention?<br>The price is also lower than that of another Thai restaurant in Haymarket<br>An extra portion of rice hasn't been served for 20 minutes, but it was served after a rush. The dishes of the guests who came later than us were served<br>Then the mango glutinous rice had to be reminded to serve. After waiting for another 12 minutes, the pot was not collected for us, and the next table was all collected. Then we found that the mango was sour and immature</span>",1 star rating,"Feb 15, 2023","Chippendale, Sydney, Australia"

There was quite a line when we stopped by but the service is stunningly efficient here and the line moved quickly. The atmosphere is fantastic and bustling, with an open kitchen and conversation all around. We ordered the crispy pork belly (soo crispy, bursting with flavor and not too spicy) and the pineapple fried rice (fyi it's got seafood in it and the pineapple adds such a unique flavor) - we stuffed our faces and were left wishing we still had room for dessert, which looked incredible!</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 3, 2019","Los Angeles, CA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">We found Home Thai on Yelp and were not disappointed!  We arrived early, just before the line formed, and were seated right away at one of two remaining tables around 5:45PM.   <br><br>It took a bit for a server to take our order, but once the order was in our food came out fast.   The massaman curry was amazing!  The beef was extremely tender and the sauce was nicely balanced with coconut, spices and peanuts all working well together.    Prices were extremely reasonable, but just a heads up that rice is $3 extra which isn't prominently noted on the menu.   <br><br>I'd suggest double checking the bill before going up to pay; we were given someone else's and it was about $35 more than ours.  <br><br>I'd agree with others to not be put off by the line.   This is not a place where people come to linger for a long time; people are coming for excellent Thai food served quickly, so tables do turn quickly!</span>",4 star rating,"Sep 29, 2016","Indianapolis, IN"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">We always passed this restaurant on our way home and it was always so busy. We just had to see what the fuss was about!<br><br>I have never been to a restaurant which delivers your food order soo fast ! I'm not even kidding too. We were so surprised. Our waitress took our order through an app? And then we got all our food and drink in less than 6 minutes. This place was so packed and busy too so it was impressive. <br><br>There is nothing bad to say about our experience. Everything from the service to the quality of food, there was nothing to falter it. Everything was so yummy and the way that Thai food was supposed to be. The pricing of everything is so affordable too. Dishes are of good quantities that you can easily share between 2 people, and are under $20. <br><br>I have to say, as a tip: you're best off trying to get there before dinner rush because there was a line of people as we were heading out even after the 8:30 mark. <br><br>All in all, I'd go back to try everything else, and it would be a place I'd order takeaway from on a weekly basis!

Totally addicted to the Green Curry Chicken and the Pad Thai is fresh and worth a try even if you're tired of having PT in other restaurants. Cannot recommend a restaurant more highly!</span>",5 star rating,"Jan 20, 2023",Location

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Arrive early to avoid a long wait time.  When we visit Home Thai, we try to arrive around 5:30 to beat the dinner crowd.<br><br>The food is authentic and delicious.  It is quite spicy, so be aware.  We always order several dishes to share and have sampled almost the entire menu over several visits.<br><br>I love the concept of the open kitchen.  You especially have a great bird's eye view from the second floor.<br><br>Be aware, they will not split checks and they charge a surcharge for using a credit card.<br><br>I find the staff to be rather rude at times and language appears to be a barrier.  We virtually have to beg for water refills.  They bring out a small pitcher that only fills our 5 small cups once.  With spicy Thai, I want water readily available.<br><br>The place is always hot, so dress for that.</span>",4 star rating,"Dec 18, 2017","Waukee, IA"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">Food is fine but ONE SERVER IS TERRIBLE <br>And whoever order this drink ( it is coconut rum malibu + coconut milk ) should drink the bottom and top separately ( please do not mix them cuz the taste gonna be abit weird ) <br>And by the way, I wish i could talk to the owner at that time.<br>Everything was good until i mix my drink together and yes they taste weird , so as a bartender, i know how to fix this thing. I simply ask for 2 pieces of LIME . And the lady who took that order look at me and ask again <br>""2 PIECES ? ""<br>And replied ""Yes ""<br>Later on a man brought out 2 Lamb skewers and i told him that it would be a mistake. Then that lady ( she looks asian and her base on her accent I guess she from Thai ) came out , took that plate from the man and put near my face <br>"" WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS "" she said ( feel like yelling honestly )<br><br>MORE IN PICTURE ( couldn't post the whole thing )</span>",2 star rating,"Oct 22, 2018","South Vancouver, Vancouver, Canada"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">After patronising this business for years - the star rating has fallen from 5 to 1. I'd give this place zero if I could! <br>Today was the worst experience I have ever had in any restaurant! On the front cover of the menus was a hand written sticker advising that there was a surcharge for Good Friday of $1 per dish. Ok fine with that. <br>After the meal, I went to pay my bill and I questioned why the surcharge was suddenly $4. I was told that I had been charged $1 per serve. The rudest female I have ever encountered, argued that there is a surcharge per food item. I said I only had three items. She then insisted that the main dish was two servings, therefore extra surcharge. <br>This escalated into an argument. She kept deliberately laughing in my face and ridiculing me saying ""Pay up now- you already have eaten! Next she was screaming ""Get out and don't come back!""<br>I have never met or been spoken to by a total bitch or low life! (You can tell I'm fuming)<br>I told her she was the rudest woman I had ever met and she then began to yell further abuse and now threatened to call the Police. <br>Not getting anywhere in reasoning about the situation, I paid cash and then left to find out I was now short changed! <br>I returned back to get the correct change - and could tell she knew that she hadn't given the right money - laughing in my face again! What a debacle on Good Friday. It certainly turned any good into bad! I will never go back to this restaurant again regardless of the food. The service is shocking and the waitresses are the rudest you'll ever find anywhere in Sydney. Just look at their scowling faces!</span>",1 star rating,"Mar 25, 2016","Sydney, Australia"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">A very popular Thai restaurant. Sometimes you have to put your name down on the door for a table. I've been coming here for about 4 years now. Always good food but sometimes the service is rushed and the wait staff not as polite as other restaurants. Tables are small in size if you order more than three dishes. However the food makes up for any shortfalls in service delivery. Two of my favourite dishes here are the Papaya Salad 'Som Tum' ($10.90) served with Stir Fried crispy pork belly with green beans, chilli, lime leaves and Pik Khing sauce. ($15.50)</span>",,,

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">If I ever come back to Sydney, this place is a must return. The restaurant has a nice ambience, where 2 to 4 people is a reasonable group to seat per table.  But, I did see a group of 7, but it was pinched. Many options to choose from the menu. <br><br>I ordered the vegetable Pad Thai, which came piping hot, right from the wok to my plate steaming hot. My preference as I dislike room temperature food.  The first bite was amazing!!!!!!! Flavours were on point and authentic. It was a bit spicy, so if you prefer less spicy, let them know beforehand. We also ordered the chili fried rice with chicken, which comes grounded. So you can barely see the chicken and it was overwhelmingly spicy. Like you were having just the chili for dinner. For those really spicy lovers, you'll really enjoy this dish. For those who want to taste and enjoy this dish, you might want to ask for less spicy beforehand.<br><br>And, if you need a washroom, go to one before you reach this restaurant. To get to their washroom, you have to step out of the restaurant, go next door, where they'll scan their keycard to get you in, and then go up a set of stairs.  Even then, I wasn't sure when was the last time that washroom was cleaned. And, it's shared amongst the people in that building, including another restaurant.</span>",4 star rating,"Jan 13, 2017","Brampton, Canada"

"<span class="" raw__09f24__T4Ezm"" lang=""en"">I've been dying to come here - had it bookmarked for two weeks now. Note - their machine didn't work for our card so that was a HUGE piss off. Luckily we had cash on us or.. I guess we woudln't have had to pay? Either way it was annoying. Mind your cash when you go, they might not be able to take your card. Docked half a star for that. <br><br>On to the food! We got:<br><br>Coconut chicken soup, chicken pad thai and the pork belly. <br><br>Coconut chicken soup required me to sift through and remove the lemongrass and cilantro (what you folks call ""coriander""). The flavors in this were mild, with exception to the obnoxiousness of what I assumed was the lemongrass. The chicken wasn't bad, but wasn't exceptional. Docked another half star for the mediocrity of this dish. <br><br>Here is where they got their stars. The pork belly and the pad thai. Both were great. Pad thai came with spices and sugar not yet mixed in. When we go again, if we get the pad thai I'll take out about half the sugar they add. A bit less sweet and it would have been perfect, but it was a satisfactory dish regardless. A bit better than Chat Thai's pad thai, if due to the customizability of the separate ingredients. <br><br>When the pork belly comes eat it right away. This dish is best when it is piping hot, and its also easier to distinguish (bones???) in the dish. It was crispy as hell (is hell crispy? I'll find out eventually), and the flavor. The flavor deserves its own poorly written paragraph.<br><br>It was this sweet-savory flavor. I wish I would have thought about it more in the moment, because all I can remember is the startling crunch, and thinking  ""should I be eating this part?""  The first few bites were absolutely incredible, succulent is the perfect word, for a lack of food-related-adjective-prowess. But that allure wears off with the temperature of the dish, we found. The pork belly would be best enjoyed by a few ravenous people who can eat it during its peak flavor and texture(right after it comes out).</span>",4 star rating,"May 17, 2016","Winnipeg, Canada"
